#### Geniology 
*  Hekate is a Titan Godess- being that she was birthed of the titans Perses (destruction) and Steria (stars). Originally, Hekate was a goddes of the Earth, Sea, and Sky;       However the Olympians winning the titan war meant she no longer needed to watch the upper plains, so she instead focused on her magical aspects in the Underworld.
*  She has no recorded birthdate, though her first noteriety is the Titan War.
#### The Titan War
*  During the Titan war Hekate remained neutral, though the Titans would have won with her help. Zeus holds her in high regard.
*  Hekate was not prosecuted by the Olympians, for she stayed neutral after the war. Since she no longer needed to rule over the upper plains (the olympians now ruled it)       she chose instead to focus on her magical aspects in the Underworld as mentioned above.
#### The Giant War
*  Hekate hadn't remained neutral during the Titan war, rather she chose to fight alongside the Olympians.
*  She battled Clytius, defeating him be lighting them on fire with her torches.
